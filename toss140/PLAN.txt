This is the current, necessarily tentative, development roadmap.

Implement counts (number of summaries per tweeter, author, organ).
- recalculate the relevant ones when a new summary is added
- an explicit recount tool that can be triggered after manual editing, or if something goes wrong
- build placeholder pages for top tweeters &c (/top/(tweeter|author|organ) ?)

Implement "sign in with twitter", with stored user info keyed by an opaque cookie value

Allow users to post summaries directly from the site

Count the retweets of each summary (and store the count with the summary)

Auto-retweet button

"Summarise this" bookmarklet, that you can click when reading an article to post a summary immediately without having to faff about shortening the link, going to twitter etc.
